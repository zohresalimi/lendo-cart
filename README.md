# Shopping Cart

## Simple React Shopping Cart

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Tech

we are useing a number of open source tools:

- [react] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [styled-components] - Visual primitives for the component age.
- [axios] - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
- [react material ui]- UI framework.

# Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zohresalimi/lendo-cart.git
```

Install all dependencies and start the project.

Note: we used `yarn` to setup this project, however, if you want to use `npm` instead, do not forget to delete the `yarn.lock` file first.
